The assignment is to find an encrypted file called personal.txt.gpg and a
wordlist called data.txt. Apparently, I need to use "tac" to reverse the 
wordlist before brute-forcing the encrypted file.

The location of personal.txt.gpg and the data.txt files are as follows :
./oldLogs/units/personal.txt.gpg
./logs/zmn/old stuff/-mvLp/data.txt

Next I use the gpg2john command as follows :
gpg2john ./personal.txt.gpg > GPGHashFile

Next, I will run john on the above hash file as follows :
john -format=gpg -wordlist=data.txt GPGHashFile
*****But******
Since they instructions say that we need to reverse the wordlist,
I first do the following :
tac data.txt > reversed_data.txt
And change the above command to :
john -format=gpg -wordlist=reversed_data.txt GPGHashFile

Thus, I was able to obtain the password.
Now, using that password, I can decrypt the file as follows:
gpg personal.txt.gpg
to obtain the information in the encrypted file.
