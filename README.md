# TryHackMe_Linux_Strength_Training
This is a repo to record how I found the flags in the Linux Strength Training room on TryHackMe. It will serve as a log for future purposes I guess or as a reference.

The files I put here are files I usually create on the deployed machine while finding the flag.
Once I find the flag or whenever I consider it appropriate, I transfer the files back to my local machine using the `scp` command.
