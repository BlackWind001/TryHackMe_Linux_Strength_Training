# TryHackMe Linux Strength Training
This is a repo to record how I found the flags in the Linux Strength Training room on TryHackMe. It will serve as a log for future purposes I guess or as a reference.

The files I put here are files I usually create on the deployed machine while finding the flag.
Once I find the flag or whenever I consider it appropriate, I transfer the files back to my local machine using the `scp` command.

I have completed all the tasks in the Linux Strength Training room and this will be my final commit to the repo.
If there is anyone other than me viewing this repo, feel free to use it as a guide to get the flags.
I have avoided giving the flag values outright wherever I could remember.
But, in case of any spoilers, I apologize.
Happy hacking.
