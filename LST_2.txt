The objective is to get the flag using the instructions from the readME_hint.txt file.
That is once I find the readME_hint.txt file.
find ./ -type f -name readME_hint.txt
./corperateFiles/RecordsFinances/readME_hint.txt
The contents of the readME_txt file are as follows
Instructions: Move the MoveMe.txt file to the march folder directory and then execute the SH program to reveal the second flag.

 you need to research three things:
				 how to execute bash files
				 how to work with files that begin with a - (dash) whether that is to do with copying or moving files 
				 how to work with files with spaces
                                   

The contents of the direcotry containing the above file are as follows:
ajkJji
CeCJDJ
GxPtUIo
hHYDeM
january
-march folder
-MoveMe.txt
readME_hint.txt
uIkmHPN

The location of the folder is ./corperateFiles/RecordsFinances/ in topson's home directory
Note that the command needs to be executed from within the above mentioned directory or an error will be thrown.
EDIT: The directory to be present in is NOT the above mentioed directory but actually the '-march folder' directory INSIDE the above mentioned directory.

Once the bash file is run from the '-march folder' directory, the flag is shown.
