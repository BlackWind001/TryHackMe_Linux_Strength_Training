This challenge is about MySQL databses.
The objective is to find a file named employees.sql and read the
database for a flag.

The directory of the file employees.sql is:
./serverLx/

So, I start mysql in said directory and use the following command :
mysql -u sarah -p
P.S: The password is password

Next, I load the file as follows :
source employees.sql

Once the loading is done, I list out the databases contained :
show databases;

The only database that stands out is : employees

Next, I navigate into the database by using the following command :
use employees;

I list out the tables in the database as follows :
show tables;

8 tables are listed. I list out the schema of the table by using :
describe [TABLE-NAME]
and check only the tables that can contain one or more varchar columns.
This is because the flag is a string.

But just to be sure, I count the number of rows in the tables
containing the varchar columns too. I don't want a huge list of rows.

The first tables turn out to be unsuspecting. But then, the table named
employees contains 300024 rows.

After a quick google search about how to locate substrings in mysql,
I came across this link :
https://www.w3resource.com/mysql/string-functions/mysql-locate-function.php

Using the example in this link as a reference, I use the following command :
select * from employees where LOCATE('Flag',first_name)>0 OR LOCATE('Flag',last_name)>0;

The first_name and last_name columns are used in the above command because,
these are the columns that use a varchar data-type.

The above command resulted in a single row - the row of emp_no 499973.
This row contained the flag in the last_name column.


Although this is the method I followed, there is probably a better way
out there and so, it is advisable to read walkthrough articles of the
Linux Strength Training room on the internet.
